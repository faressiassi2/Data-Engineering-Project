# Data-Engineering-Project

# Overview
The aims of this project is to use a very essentiel tool for Data Engineering Spark to analyze,preprocess and create a classification Machine Learning model and then evaluate this model using Spark. For that I use the datasets show here: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tylerx/flights-and-airportsdata?select=flights.csv
I'll start by extracting the data into a pyspark dataframe.
Then performing data analysis and preprocessing.
After creating a Machine Learning model using the data preprocessed.
Evaluate this model using some metrics for classification.
Finally I'll use Apache Airflow to orchestrate all of this data pipeline.
